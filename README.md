# Braille
OpenCV project that translates an image with braille into text.

Not very robust at the moment and can only translate braille that has the propper dimensions and alignment as specified in the US braille standards.

There are also different ways to express several symbols such as a period, and as of right now the code only accounts for one of them.
It also doesn't handle indicators to capitalize the entire word or numbers with more than one digit.
